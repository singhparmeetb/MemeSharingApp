# Meme Sharing App

This is a simple Meme sharing app which uses a meme API. This was made as a way to test my android coding skills and I am pretty happy with the outcome.
  
The UI is kept minimal with a simple theme followed by an added "Download" button.
Tried to use material widgets to keep the look modern along with sleek curved image holder and buttons.
You can enjoy memes and can even download them.
## Installation

Installation is pretty easy. 
You just need to import this project into your Android Studio and then simply build it.
You can run it on android 5 or higher.
